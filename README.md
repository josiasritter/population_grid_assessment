# population_grid_assessment
This repository contains the code and research data of a study that evaluates the accuracy of global gridded population datasets in 307 rural areas around the world.

1. multipops_all.py is the main program that estimates the population amounts in the rural areas for five global gridded population datasets.
2. multipops_validation_lowfilters.py is the program that carries out the validation procedure against reported rural populations and generates plots
3. results.geojson is the resulting polygon file that includes the rural areas evaluated, the estimated rural populations, and the reported rural populations.
